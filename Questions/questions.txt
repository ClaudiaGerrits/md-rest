Level 3 Questions

1) Which stages of an activity lifecycle exists?
2) Explore this app: https://github.com/marcellis/demolifecycle (in Java)  and examine which lifecycle events are fired navigating from one activity to the other.
3) Which are the two kind of intents, and what is the difference?
4) What is the difference between Parcelables and Serializables?
5) What is the purpose of the analyzer?

1) onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy().
2) onCreate(), onStart(), onResume()
3) Explicit and implicit. Explicit directly adresses a target and implicit just "tags" the intent for any other part of the application to pick up
4) parcable is bad for storage but better for performance compared to serializable
5) it is your linter
